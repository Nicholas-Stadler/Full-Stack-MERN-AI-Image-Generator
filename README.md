# Full-Stack-MERN-AI-Image-Generator

I created my own improved version of an AI Image Generator using the OpenAI API.

AI image generation tools such as MidJourney and DALL-E have taken over the tech space. These tools are able to create a wide range of images, everything from memes and art to UI and UX designs. 

This application was made using React, MongoDB, Cloudinary, and Node
